Build notes

mvn clean install

Optionally you can skip tests (-DskipTests) or skip some static analysis (-DskipChecks). This does improve the build time but could hide problems in your code. For binding development you want to run that command without skipping checks and tests. To check if your code is following the code style run mvn spotless:check. If Maven prints [INFO] Spotless check skipped then run mvn spotless:check -Dspotless.check.skip=false instead as the check is not mandatory yet. To reformat you code run mvn spotless:apply.
